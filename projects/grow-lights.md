# 3× 150W 7-Band Spectrum LED Grow Lights

**Type:** Personal Project  
**Focus:** High-power LED builds • Assembly & wiring • Reliability/testing • Repeatable build process  
**Power Class:** 150W (per unit) • **Quantity:** 3 units

## Overview
Built three 150W, 7-band spectrum LED fixtures intended for plant growth applications. The goal was to create reliable, repeatable units with consistent performance across builds, using a product-minded process (assembly, validation, and iteration).

## Requirements (What success meant)
- Build multiple units with consistent construction and behavior (repeatability)
- Ensure stable operation in real-world use over extended periods
- Maintain practical mounting and wiring that holds up to everyday handling
- Validate functionality and ensure each unit performs as intended before use

## Design & Build Notes
- Assembled and wired high-power LED systems at the 150W class
- Used a multi-band spectrum configuration (7-band) to target plant growth needs
- Designed the physical mounting and layout for practical deployment (fixture form factor)
- Standardized the build approach so all three units followed the same process

## Validation & Testing
- Performed functional validation for each unit prior to real-world use
- Conducted real-use testing in plant growth environments to confirm sustained operation
- Compared behavior across all three builds to ensure consistency and spot-check for anomalies
- Made adjustments to improve reliability and repeatability where needed

## Challenges & Fixes (Examples)
- **Consistency across builds:** ensuring each unit matches expected behavior  
  **Fix:** documented a repeatable assembly process and validated each unit using the same checklist
- **Sustained operation:** maintaining stable performance over time  
  **Fix:** iterated on mounting/wiring practices to reduce failure points in practical use

## Next Improvements
- Add a more formal test checklist (power-up, thermal check, extended run test)
- Add clearer serviceability (modular wiring, labeled connections)
- Improve enclosure/strain relief and cable management for long-term durability
- Add measurement-based verification where possible (power draw, temperature, output consistency)
